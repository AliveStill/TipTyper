# Tiptyper

The simple plain-text editor for OS X.

## About

After I got frustrated with the default Mac OS X text editor (TextEdit) for doing simple tasks, I decided to make my own custom plain text editor with the stuff I needed. I like using simple editors to make quick fixes on code files and to write notes. Since TextEdit supports RTF, whenever I pasted any content from the web it would transform my text to RTF and break everything. This also happened if you opened an HTML file with it... No good experiences at all.

TipTyper is the product of this frustration. It does everything I need, is lightweight and fully integrated to the most recent technologies from Mac OS X. The features include:

* Lines display (hideable, ⌘L).
* Words counter (hideable, ⌘D).
* Display invisible characters feature (⌘I).
* Go to Line feature (⌘⇧L).
* Customizable Toolbar with multiple useful buttons.
* Automatic Tabs insertion feature to make coding easier. (Disabled by default)
* Smart indentation algorithm, supporting loose, selected and multiple selected blocks of text
* Editor Margin feature, available from the Toolbar.
* Characters counter.
* True Full-Screen support.
* Retina screen ready.
* Support for dictation and speech.
* Spell check and grammar.
* Automatic update checker and downloader (thanks to Sparkle).
* The minimum supported OS X version is OS X 10.7, but it was only tested on OS X 10.9 and 10.10. Feedback is welcome!

I most certainly wish to add more features in the future versions, so if you use it, please stay tuned!
